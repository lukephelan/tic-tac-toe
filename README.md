### Tic-Tac-Toe

Two player game of tic-tac-toe.

If there are two players, first player is always X.

Currently single player does not work. BUT, it will mean there is an easy
or a hard option. The hard option has an AI that always chooses the best
square based on player one's choice. The easiest option just chooses
random squares.

Difficulty still needs to disappear unless player chooses one player.

Currently user name goes nowhere.

Need to add a vertical, diagonal and horizontal line across the winning squares.
